                <p>Another cold day in Novosibirsk. The lab feels different today - warmer, despite the Siberian winter outside. I've finally done it. The initial tests on the sunlight alteration device were successful. The way it breaks down pure solar radiation into its components is unlike anything I've seen before.</p>
                <p>Father's lectures about excellence echo in my mind. This could be my chance to prove myself, to win the National Technological Advancement Competition. To finally break free from his shadow. Mother seems proud, though she's always been the gentler one, my refuge when Father's expectations become too heavy.</p>
                <p>The possibilities are endless. Clean energy, enhanced agriculture, a chance to heal this broken world. I have to be careful though - such power needs to be handled responsibly.</p>

                <p>Something strange happened today. Two men in dark suits visited the lab. They didn't introduce themselves, but their posture screamed military. Mother seemed to know them - I caught a glimpse of her nodding to them in the hallway. When I asked her about it later, she brushed it off with a smile. "Just some old colleagues, dear. Nothing to worry about."</p>
                <p>Later, I found one of my research journals out of place. Nothing seems to be missing, but... I'm going to start keeping more detailed records. Just in case.</p>
