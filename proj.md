"Hello Ms. Zehra,

I am making an Alternative Reality Game(ARG) and found that creating it in English would be the most beneficial for me. But since this is a topic that not many people know about, I will assume you don't either, and explain what it is. In its simplest form, an ARG is a story told through different platforms such as websites, real-world locations(geocaching), etc with an element of horror. This form of storytelling holds a special place in my heart because it has earned me a lifelong friend group of 6(which I can't access now because Discord has been banned). I have created an ARG and participated in multiple. I have been trying to make a good one for about a year and came up with this idea on a road trip to Trabzon. You could search more about the topic but I want to get to the idea.

In the Siberian cold of Novosibirsk Anastasia "Anya" Pavlova was working in her laboratory. Amid all this chaos, a glowing light was seen, and the core of Anya's sunlight alteration machine was glowing like a star on her desk. This was a marvelous system that could break down sunlight into its sole radiation and change it/amplify it.

She was sure this would win her the prestigious National Technological Advancement Competition. Her winning this wouldn't just achieve her glory, it would secure a feature outside her father's force. Her father, Sergei Pavlov, was strict at home. Every evening was a long lecture. It was clear she had to excel, or there would be consequences.

At work, Sergei was hard to read. He was charismatic and commanding. He was very traditional. His loyalty to his country and family was really confusing for Anya. But her mother Irina helped balance out her father's severity. When her father's expectations were crushing Anya, she fled to her mother's arms for her to comfort and relax her. What Anya couldn't understand though was her role in the KGB. She was a controller, managing the flow of confidential information through the committee.

Months passed as Anya worked on perfecting the machine and it gave her hope that this broken world could once again be reunited with clean energy and sustainable power. But she still doubted what would happen if it went into the wrong hands(subtle foreshadowing, it did).

Her father's interest in her work increased over time. He asked specific questions about her work. When her project was finished, Sergei took her project claiming to show it to people who could potentially get her a prestigious sponsor.

Six months later the machine came back but, not in the way Anya had hoped. Her father had rebranded her machine, presenting it to the KGB as a deadly weapon capable of destroying countries in mere days. Anya's invention which could potentially benefit the whole world was being used for worse purposes and could amplify the worst form of radiation to people.

The KGB immediately started working on a payload releasing a specific selection of radiation into strategic areas. It could disorient people, leaving them in a near-comatose state, being manipulated easily, or outright disappearance. The test site was chosen, a small town in the middle of Oklahoma.

The start began quietly. The machine was running at low power to test its capabilities. People began vanishing, not literally. They seemed lifeless and couldn't be moved, like in a coma but standing/alive. Witnesses reported seeing frozen people in public places: a jogger in a park and a man looking at the sunset completely dried out of life on his balcony. These people were meant to be collected by agents, but something seemed to go wrong.

The agents were late. By the time they arrived, all the frozen figures had disappeared. No trace of their existence was left, only an empty space in the people who once loved them's hearts.

Anya, back in Novosibirsk, watched news reports of people disappearing. Each time with more worry. While the exact mechanism wasn't released to the public she understood the signs. This was her machine. Her creation created with an innocent purpose was now being used to bring people into a coma.

The news reports grew darker as days passed. The machine was no longer running at low power. Entire neighborhoods began to report strange behavior. People started acting robotically, some were frozen in place. Like time had simply stopped for them. This was like a plague that was double as infectious.

While walking from school, Anya was approached by a stranger. This man was wearing a covering coat and covered his face, almost like a member of a secret organization wanting to inform Anya of something. He slipped a note right before disappearing into the crowd. The note read as follows:

"We know who you are, we know what you did. If you want to stop this, meet us at <Insert random location inside Izmir that isn't far>. Come alone(to build up ambition)."

Anya doubted its reality but knew she couldn't ignore it. At the place, she met a resistance group calling themselves Solstice. They were a group of hackers, scientists, and ex-KGB agents. Their leader was an ex-controller at the KGB called Mira Volkov. Mira told her that she once worked for Irina before defecting. She told her that she defected because of the KGB's willingness to sacrifice morals for power.

Mira said, with no emotion in her eyes: "Your creation... It is only the beginning. They plan for something far worse. It's called Project Sunfall"
(Their refers to the KGB our refers to the Solstice)
Mira explained that the low-power mode tests were just a warning. They plan to create a worldwide devastator. This could put entire continents into anarchy. Leaving Russia as the only superpower.

The hacker group of the Solstice managed to crack in one of the confidential lines of the KGB. They documented this as a video note. They had the KGB's plans for a final test of the machine. It was scheduled to be on a Coronal mass Ejection, which would exponentially increase the power of the machine. The event was called Sunfall.

The resistance needed Anya's help to stop the machine and Anya knew this, so she agreed. As she worked with the Solstice she uncovered that her dad didn't commit the initial theft, her mother was the mastermind behind this chaos. She had made an elite faction inside the KGB working for a new world, one where nations were controlled by obedience under a single rule.

What made it worse was that she didn't even deny it when confronted:

"I did it for you, Anya. This world is broken beyond repair. This is the only way we can fix this, obedience."

Anya was broken and confused. Who could she trust if she couldn't even trust her own family?

With Solstice's help, Anya made a plan to sabotage the machine before the event. The team broke into one of the key facilities in Kaliningrad, where the machine was being held. The tension was easily observable as they made their way through the layers of security, each layer bringing Anya to her once proudest creation.

Things didn't go as planned; nothing ever does in this world. The KGB expected the Solstice and equipped the machine with security features. Mira and several members of Solstice were captured. Irina managed to talk to Anya asking her to reconsider:

"This isn't about power Anya, we need humanity to adapt. We will control the world while the rest obey. Don't make a fool of yourself."

Anya refused, narrowly escaping.

As the big day approached, Solstice grouped in an underground bunker. Anya was in a bigger and better laboratory at the bunker and she found a big flaw in the machine design. The machine needed one specific frequency to balance out the rays and actually work. Overloading this frequency also overworks the core, in turn damaging the machine beyond repair. But it would require physical access to the machine.

The team started an operation called "Sunrise". They would take all measures to stop this once and for all. The sky turned red and Sunfall began to work at full power, letting Solstice know that they needed to hurry up.

They fought through the rooms and corridors, finally reaching the final room that the machine was kept in to find that her father was waiting for her. He learned about her wife's betrayal.

"This never was what I wanted, but I don't know how to stop it."

Sergei was bound to help her. Together, they started to work on the plan. With Sergei's advanced technology, it was easier. As the core began destabilizing, Anya's mother appeared one last time.

"You're throwing the future away" she lunged at Anya.

Sergei sacrificed himself to protect Anya. In all that struggle, his final words were: "Be better than us."

Anya successfully managed to overload the machine, but she couldn't do it in time to prevent it entirely. It sent a devastating shock wave through the western hemisphere. Power grids failed, and Any form of online communication was demolished. Worst of all millions of people froze, nearly in a coma. Anya and Solstice worked hard to repair the damage, but the world was never the same again.

Months later Anya was living in a quiet city. She had a small chest that contained a photo of her dad. Her invention made millions suffer but brought people together in unimaginable ways.

Sunfall was a tragedy, but also a warning - A warning of what humanity could lose if power went into the wrong hands.

This was only the good ending, however, the participants of the game will choose what Anya does and may fall into the bad ending where Irina wins. I am working on 10 other endings such as tragic, surprise(this will be presented to the players as a question mark), neutral, etc. but they are not ready at the moment, so I will just stick with good and bad for now, so expect more to come. So let's get to the bad ending.

Sunrise was Solstice's last hope to finish this once and for all. They had meticulously planned everything from start to finish but the KGB was one step ahead.

As Solstice started the operation they encountered unexpected resistance, as if the KGB had already known what they were doing. This wasn't KGB intercepting their communication lines, it was much worse. It was Mira Volkov, she had been a double agent all along.

"You didn't think you could outsmart the sacred KGB right?" Mira screamed while holding Anya at gunpoint "You don't know what we are trying to achieve, this isn't destruction, this is salvation"

This broke the team apart, several were heavily injured and several were captured. Mira destroyed some key components of Operation Sunrise and Anya was left the only functioning member of the team. 

Anya was tired and faced many difficulties because she was alone. She finally reached the room where the machine was kept, her father was lying on the floor, looking defeated he said:

"Anya, she has gone too far, it's too late. She locked it, even I can't override the machine now."

Before Anya could process this Irina and a bunch of heavily armed guards entered the room.

"You don't know what you are going against, this isn't about power, it's about survival. Humanity is broken beyond repair-war, greed, poverty. We can fix this, Sunfall will bring order."

Anya was shaking. "You're destroying consciousness, this is not order, it's slavery. What's the point of fixing the planet if there is no one to experience it?"

Irina softened, "You'll understand someday. Only then you'll thank me."

Anya tried one last time, with the tools she brought. Irina didn't even bother to stop her, she let Anya approach the core knowing she couldn't do anything to stop it. As Anya was trying to overload the core Irina activated a failsafe, blowing Anya back.


"You were always brilliant my little angel, but you didn't even have a chance."

Sergei lunged at Irina with his last ounce of power, trying to disable the failsafe. He succeeded but got shot in the process. He collapsed and his final words were, "Forgive me, live."

Anya was heartbroken, she could only watch as Irina started Sunfall.

The sky turned red, with the machine running at an unimaginable power due to the Coronal Mass Ejection(CME). Billions of people froze, only moving under the instructions of the new world control.

The machine far extended over its intended range, soon they controlled Europe, Asia, and Africa. Governments turned into anarchy, and anarchy turned into obedience. People who resisted were quickly captured, some freezing, some disappearing entirely.

The KGB had won, and Irina was finally the ruler of the world. Irina's elite faction enforced obedience, crushing any remnants of resistance. Solstice was disbanded, with surviving members either freezing or hiding.

Months later, the world was unrecognizable. Nations weren't relevant, borders didn't exist. Humanity was unified under a single big force but at the cost of free will. Frozen people were reactivated as workers and slaves. 

Anya was living away from Novosibirsk, walking on the ruins of a society that was once unrestricted. She has been living with her failure that destroyed the world. She avoided people, her invention was the cause of this tragedy.

Irina was standing, proud of what she had done, in her mighty castle. She monitored the World through holograms that showed her what was happening.

"Look at what we have done," She said to Mira "No more war or chaos. Pure humanity at its finest."

Now her most trusted adviser, Mira said "What about Anya?"

"She'll come around, or get replaced. No need for betrayals."

In the final moments of the ARG Anya is seen at a laboratory abandoned by the lead scientist at Solstice. There were notes about a counter against the machine and a cure for people already frozen.

As she read sounds of drones started to get closer, and Irina was closing in. Time was running out and the world had already fallen.

The bad ending leaves the world trapped under Irina's rule with only a speck of hope that someone, someday, might find a cure.

And the curtains close until season 2 if demand is high. This was one of my best storylines and I spent 2 months on this + the time spent coming up with the idea, about 2 years and 2 weeks spent on writing this out on a document. I'm really proud of how this turned out, much better than what I could ever expect. 

I graded this paper and it said 97/100 which is an A+ and another test says it's 11-12th grade level. So I think each sentence in this story should be three points. Two is fine too but three is much more appreciated. There are 183 sentences in this text which equals 549 points if each sentence is 3(I beg you, please), and 366 if 2.

But my main purpose wasn't just to get points, I wanted to present this. As I mentioned at the start of the mail, I am really interested in making alternative reality games, and this is the perfect storyline to create one.

I created a scenario that is really bad but I will improve it later since I'm crunching right now and need to get this done in 40 minutes.

We reveal the start through a video, and at the end in the captions for a split-second a base 64 code flashes. When decoded it will link to Anya's blog website. When his dad takes the project for "sponsors" Anya wants to do a live event and codes a big project on how the machine will work and how the sponsors can help it. As she is presenting the project live someone, or something intervenes. Tells us some nonsense about a sun falling? But the stream continues as normal. In the blog, Anya notices this and says, "I found the source, <video link>" In the video while explaining who the sponsors and that type of people are a sort of Morse code flashes at the top. But I won't work too much on the implementation because it's bad anyway, and I will improve it later. We can talk about this at school.

So to sum it all up, I will mail you about the other endings and the implementation. All You need to do is reply to this exact mail or send me a new one answering these questions: "How many points did I gain from this?", "Will this be able to be implemented in a way that doesn't critically damage the curriculum?", and if it does "Will we be able to do this this year?" I am highly motivated to finish this project but everything is in your hands, Ms. Zehra. Please read the whole thing before answering.

Sincerely,
Hasan Arın Yurtsever

I'm making an arg, Everything on this arg will be hosted on a website and nothing more, the website will be static, for videos there should be no animation, and no real life filming, anything that can be made through capcut works. Can we brainstorm on the implementation?
In the "bad ending," Solstice is betrayed by Mira, who turns out to be a double agent. Anya’s efforts to stop the machine fail as Irina activates Sunfall, plunging the world into chaos and reducing humanity to obedient drones under the KGB's control. Billions lose their free will as nations crumble, leaving only Anya as a flicker of hope. Isolated and burdened by guilt, Anya stumbles upon notes about a possible cure in an abandoned Solstice lab. However, Irina’s forces are closing in, and time is running out. This storyline showcases a high-stakes battle between morality and power, offering multiple endings based on the participants' choices. It emphasizes themes of sacrifice, trust, and the dangers of unchecked ambition, setting the stage for a thrilling and interactive Alternative Reality Game. The website should give information piece by piece with thep layer earning through their new piece of story, now give me a detailed pathway of the player, like how they solve puzzles and stuff
Don't use videos where people talk, maybe vhs tapes of documentation but no modern videos of people talking"
